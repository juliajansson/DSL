--Cardinality of Bool is 2
--Cardinality of Weekday is 7

--Let cardinality of a be m
--Let cardinality of b be n

--The cardinality of Either a b is m+n since we have m Left a alternatives and n Right b alternatives

--The cardinality of (a,b) is m*n since we have n values of b for every a, which are m in cardinality

--The cardinality of a -> b is n^m. For every value of a we have n different values that can be assigned to it.
